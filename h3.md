## Making custom Arch Linux -live usb-stick

Github page for the project is up!

First commit editor defaulted to vim, so following line was added
to user/.bash_profile

	export GIT_EDITOR=nano

I'm looking at the guide on Arch Wiki to do this:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso

My goal is to have a live Arch Linux stick with ready configurations for
Saltstack and networking.

Setting up the files and committing:

	# pacman -S archiso
	# cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/ ~/archlive

## c) Git commands

	# git log
