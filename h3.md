## Making custom Arch Linux -live usb-stick

Github page for the project is up!

First commit editor defaulted to vim, so following line was added
to user/.bash_profile

	export GIT_EDITOR=nano

I'm looking at the guide on Arch Wiki to do this:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso

My goal is to have a live Arch Linux bootable iso image on a usb
stick with ready configurations for Saltstack and networking.

Setting up the files and committing:

	# pacman -S archiso
	# cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/ ~/archlive

## c) Git commands

First one on the list is 'git log'. The command shows all the commits
made.

Had to use 4 backticks in markdown language to display 3 backtick commits
properly above.

Git blame can be used on individual files, here it shows all the modifications
done, who did it and when with the README.md file here so far:

```
