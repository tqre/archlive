## Making custom Arch Linux -live usb-stick

Github page for the project is up!

First commit editor defaulted to vim, so following line was added
to user/.bash_profile

	export GIT_EDITOR=nano

I'm looking at the guide on Arch Wiki to do this:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso

My goal is to have a live Arch Linux bootable iso image on a usb
stick with ready configurations for Saltstack and networking.

Setting up the files and committing:

	# pacman -S archiso
	# cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/ ~/archlive

## c) Git commands

First one on the list is 'git log'. The command shows all the commits

Had to use 4 backticks in markdown language to display 3 backtick commits
properly above.

Git blame can be used on individual files, here it shows all the modifications
done, who did it and when with the README.md file here so far:

## e) Make a new salt state - ufw

The current configuration of my master is in another git repo:

https://github.com/tqre/archlive-saltmaster

### Setting up a firewall

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall

The package is already installed on my live setups, but I'll make
sure it stays so.

First make an appropriate directory for the salt-master, and then I
construct an init.sls file.

```
mkdir /srv/salt/ufw
echo "ufw:\n  pkg.installed" > /srv/salt/ufw/init.sls
cat /srv/salt/ufw/init.sls
ufw:
  pkg.installed
```

I don't have copypasting options on the testing master, so I cloned
this repository to the master, and edit this file inside the testing
master. This way I can write the output of the test command straight
into this file, and update it on the repo.

```
# salt '*' state.apply ufw >> h3.md

min-5:
----------
          ID: ufw
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: All specified packages are already installed

Summary for min-5
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:  32.831 ms
```

This seems to work. I'll commit this change and configure the firewall.

I'll configure the minion's firewall to only accept connections from
the master. The master's ip is already in /tmp/minion/master_ip, so it
can be read from there.

There are many configuration files, and they all have to be managed.
First I'll check how to manage an entire directory and its contents with
salt. The following looks like the right documentation entry:

https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.recurse

On master, I'll first copy the entire default configuration to /srv/salt/ufw/config
and see if I can manage it with the recurse-statements in salt.

`# cp -rT /etc/ufw/ /srv/salt/ufw/config`

I'll add the following lines to the ufw/init.sls

```
/etc/ufw:
  file.recurse:
    - source: salt://ufw/config
```

Then I'll make a test file to the masters directory to see if it gets
handled on the minion:
```
# touch /srv/salt/ufw/config/test
# salt '*' state.apply ufw >> h3.md

```

This worked! The reason I created the test file was that the settings files
were in default state on both machines, so some difference had to be made.

This was a useful source while digging the right syntax.

https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/best_practices.html

Now the file looks like this, service is enabled, and watching multiple
files is accomplished:

```
ufw:
  pkg.installed
  
/etc/ufw:
  file.recurse:
    - source: salt://ufw/config
    - watch_in:
      - service: ufw
    
firewall:
  service.running:
    - name: ufw
```

I'll change one of the files and run the state again:
```
# salt '*' state.apply ufw

I'll configure the firewall bit later... at least the service is up.
